## How to Request Features
1. Check the [issues](https://github.com/ulusata/IronStags-FRC/issues) to see if the feature has already been requested.
2. If not, open a new issue using the [feature request template](https://github.com/ulusata/IronStags-FRC/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and describe the feature, why it's needed, and how it might be implemented.

## Development Workflow

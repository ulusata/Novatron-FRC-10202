# IronStags
Welcome to the FRC Robot Project repository! This repository houses the codebase for our team's robot, developed for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Our goal is to create a robust, efficient, and innovative robot that excels in the challenges presented during the competition season.

## Repository Structure
* _**/src:**_ Contains the main robot code and unit tests.
* _**/docs:**_ Comprehensive documentation and guidelines for contributors.
* _**/simulations:**_ Simulation files and instructions for testing robot behavior virtually.
* _**/.github:**_ GitHub-specific configurations, including workflows and templates for issues and pull requests.

## Key Features
* **Command-Based Programming:** Organized and modular robot code using the Command-Based model.
* **Continuous Integration:** Automated testing and deployment with GitHub Actions.
* **Simulation Support:** Tools and instructions for simulating robot operations.
